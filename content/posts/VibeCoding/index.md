<!-- ## What Is Vibe Coding?

If you're not familiar with the term, vibe coding is the practice of using an AI agent to write code and entire projects for you. Basically, you think of an idea in your head, then tell the agent to start writing your idea. You go back and forth with it a few times to add all the features you want, then *boom* you have a working project!

## How do I Vibe Code?

The first step is to install an AI agent capable of editing files. Examples of this include, but are not limited to,

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [VSCode's GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)

What all these have in common is that under the hood they offer AI code editing, and agentic programming via a chat interface. This allows the AI to edit files, execute commands, and write code on your behalf. The setup process is actually quite simple. For this example, we'll be using Cursor as that's my preferred editor.

1. Sign up for [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).
2. Install Cursor on your computer.
3. Create a new directory for your project.
4. Open Cursor in that directory.
5. Press `Ctrl+I` if you're on Linux/Windows, or `Cmd+I` if you're on macOS to open the chat interface.
6. Type your idea for a project into the chat box.
7. Watch it code.

You'll have to approve the changes it makes by default, however you can switch it to YOLO mode in the settings which will automatically approve the changes and run commands for you. ***This is dangerous, use it at your own risk!***
