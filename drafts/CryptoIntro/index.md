title: From Crypto Dummy to Developer
---

When I was asked if I wanted to participate in a crypto startup I was quite skeptical at first. The only experience with Crypto I had was from trying to Mine Bitcoin on my shitty 2GB graphics card from 2015, as well as planning on making a Chia Farm but never going though on the opportunity. Then I was informed that you could write code for the blockchain that did different transactions or could update the blockchain, there are these things called liquid staking platforms that allow people to earn interest on their crypto while also being able to sell their stake like a bond, and that there are decentralized methods of doing a liquid staking platform, and that some company that did this made $73 million in 3 months, and .....

If this all sounds confusing, that's where I was at in January of 2022 when I was asked to participate in new crypto venture. I knew that crypto was an anonymous and decentralized way to trade currency, and that it can be mined on a GPU, but that's it. I knew it was one of the *many* reasons GPUs were so damn expensive. But there was a **lot** of things I didn't know about it. After researching everything, I came to the conclusion that this venture would either bankrupt me, or I'd be a pioneer in a new industry. So, as I'm young and still in college, I said "Fuck it, why not?"
